\usage{
cfr_time_varying(
  data,
  epidist = NULL,
  burn_in = get_default_burn_in(epidist),
  smoothing_window = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \verb{<data.frame>} containing the outbreak data. A daily time
series with dates or some other absolute indicator of time (e.g. epiday or
epiweek) and the numbers of new cases and new deaths at each time point.
Note that the required columns are "date" (for the date), "cases" (for the
number of reported cases), and "deaths" (for the number of reported deaths)
on each day of the outbreak.

Note that the \verb{<data.frame>} is required to have an unbroken sequence of
dates with no missing dates in between. The "date" column must be of class
\code{Date} (see \code{\link[=as.Date]{as.Date()}}).

Note also that the total number of cases must be greater than the total
number of reported deaths.}

\item{epidist}{An optional argument for the delay distribution used, in the
form of an \verb{<epidist>} object.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which case no delay correction is applied.
Passing an \verb{<epidist>} automatically applies delay correction in the
severity estimation.}

\item{burn_in}{A single integer value for the number of time-points
(typically days) to disregard at the start of the time-series, if a burn-in
period is desired.

When an \verb{<epidist>} is provided and delay correction is requested, the
default value is set to the mean of the \verb{<epidist>}.

Defaults to 7 if no \verb{<epidist>} is provided, or if the \verb{<epidist>} is not
parameterised. This is a sensible default value that disregards the first
week of cases and deaths, assuming daily data.

To consider all case data including the start of the time-series, set this
argument to 0.}

\item{smoothing_window}{An \emph{odd} number determining the smoothing window size
to use when smoothing the case and death time-series, using a rolling median
procedure (as the \code{k} argument to \code{\link[stats:runmed]{stats::runmed()}}) before calculating the
time-varying severity.

The default behaviour is to apply no smoothing. The minimum value of this
argument is 1.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<data.frame>} containing the maximum likelihood estimate estimate
and 95\% confidence interval of the corrected severity.
}
\description{
Calculates how the severity of a disease changes over time
while optionally correcting for reporting delays using an epidemiological
delay distribution of the time between symptom onset and death
(onset-to-death).

\section{Details: Adjusting for delays between two time series}{
This function estimates the number of cases which have a known outcome over
time, following Nishiura et al. (2009).
The function calculates a quantity \eqn{k_t} for each day within the input
data, which represents the number of cases with a known outcome, on day
\eqn{t}. \eqn{k_t} is calculated in the following way:
\deqn{k_t = \sum_{j = 0}^t c_t f_{j - t}}

We then assume that the severity measure, for example CFR, of interest is
binomially distributed, in the following way:

\deqn{d_t \sim {\sf Binomial}(k_t, \theta_t)}

We use maximum likelihood estimation to determine the value of \eqn{\theta_t}
for each \eqn{t}, where \eqn{\theta} represents the severity measure of
interest.

The epidemiological delay distribution passed to \code{epidist} is used to obtain
a probability mass function parameterised by time; i.e. \eqn{f(t)} which
gives the probability a case has a known outcomes (usually, death) at time
\eqn{t}, parameterised with disease-specific parameters before it is supplied
here.
